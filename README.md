# CODEX-CML-BM

# Introduction

This projectâ€™s data analysis is based on the Enable Medicine platform, which provides an end-to-end workflow for data processing and interpretation. Some of the code packages used in our analysis were internally developed by Enable Medicine and are designed to function exclusively within this platform, so we are unable to share them.

However, we are publicly sharing our analysis pipeline to provide insights into our approach and to help others develop their own workflows. We hope this resource serves as a useful reference for researchers working on similar projects.

## Introduction

[Provide a detailed overview of the project, its objectives, and any relevant background information.]

## Data Access

This project utilizes data hosted on Enable Medicine's cloud platform. Please note:

- **Access Restrictions**: The datasets are proprietary and require appropriate permissions for access.
- **Access Procedure**: To request access, please contact Enable Medicine directly or reach out to our team for guidance.

Ensure compliance with all applicable data usage agreements and institutional policies when handling this data.

## Dependencies

The analysis relies on several R packages, some of which are proprietary:

- **Open-source Packages**:
  - `tidyverse`: A collection of R packages for data science.
  - `magrittr`: Provides the forward-pipe operator (`%>%`).
  - `patchwork`: Facilitates combining multiple `ggplot2` plots.

- **Proprietary Packages**:
  - `emconnect`: [Description of the package's functionality.]
  - `SpatialMap`: [Description of the package's functionality.]
  - `facil`: [Description of the package's functionality.]

Access to proprietary packages may require specific permissions or licenses. Please consult the respective package documentation or contact Enable Medicine for more information.

## Usage
